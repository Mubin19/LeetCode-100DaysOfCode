You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"


Solution - 

class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {


        // XORing (^=) a number with itself cancels out to zero, and XORing a number with zero leaves the number unchanged.
        // XORing a number with another second number and then XORing the result with the second number will give the first number.
        // so the characters that appear in both will cancel each other out, leaving the extra character


        char result = 0;
        for (char c: s.toCharArray()) result ^= c;
        for (char c: t.toCharArray()) result ^= c;
        return result;
    }
