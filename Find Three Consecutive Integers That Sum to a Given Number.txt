Given an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.


Example 1:

Input: num = 33
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
Example 2:

Input: num = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
 

Solution - 


class Solution {
    public long[] sumOfThree(long num) {

        long x = num/3;
        long[] ans = new long[3];

        if(num % 3 != 0){
            return new long[]{};
        }

        ans[0] = x-1;
        ans[1] = x;
        ans[2] = x+1;

    // System.out.println(Arrays.toString(ans));
        return ans;

        
    }
}
